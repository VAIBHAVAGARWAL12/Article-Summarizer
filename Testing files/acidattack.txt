An acid attack involves the premeditated throwing of acid on a victim, usually on her face. It is a gender-based heinous crime against women. In addition to causing psychological trauma, acid attacks result in severe pain, permanent disfigurement, subsequent infections, often blindness in one or both eyes.  According to the National Commission of India, an acid attack is "any act of throwing acid or using acid in any form on the victim with the intention of or with the knowledge that such person is likely to cause to the other person permanent or partial damage or deformity or disfiguration to any part of the body of such person".Acid attack on women is increasing day by day, basically on the girls in the age of 11-30 years. The most common types of acid utilized in these assaults include sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acid. . Several community awareness programs are being conducted by local authorities and administrative departments, to make people aware of this heinous crime. This paper wants to highlight the causes and impact of the acid attack on innocent women and the problems or hindrances suffered by the victims.This is one of the major causes for throwing acid on the victim. When a person is rejected of his marriage proposal or advances of a person are rebuffed by a woman, it is taken as spite, and out of vengeance, acid is used on the woman to teach her a lesson. For the committer, it hardly takes few moments to throw the acid on the victim and satisfy a grisly sense of retaliation against the seeming denunciation. These people fail to comprehend that the lesson that they are teaching is not temporary, but is permanent which spoils not only the looks of the woman but also has a devastating effect on her life throughout.Consequences Of Acid Attacks: Physical consequences: Acid burns through skin and flesh, layer by layer, causing great pain and injury. It eats through the two layers of the skin, into the fat and muscle underneath, and sometimes down to the bone, it may dissolve the bone. The profoundness of injury depends on the brawn of the acid and the duration of the contact with the skin - the burning goes on until the acid is scrupulously washed off with water. Further, if thrown on a person's face, acid speedily eats into eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. The pain is agonizing, as a strong burning heat cuts through the victim's flesh like a hot knife. Eyelids and lips may burn off completely. The nose may melt, closing the nostrils, and ears shrivel up. Acid can rapidly destroy the eye, causing the victim to be blind. Skin and bone of the skull, forehead, cheeks, and chin may melt. The acid usually splashes or drips over the neck, chest, back, arms, or legs, burning anywhere it touches. One study found that on average, the patient suffered by acid attack burns to 14% of their body surface area, with areas most commonly affected including the face (87% of the victims), head and neck (67%), upper limbs (60%) and chest (54%). Around a third of victims (31%) suffered complete or partial blindness.Psychological Consequences:A psychological trauma is suffered by the victim when she perceives that her skin is burnt off and after the attack the defacement and the disabilities with which they have to bear for the rest of their lives. Some of the psychological problems which the victims suffer are insomnia, nightmares, depression, fear of facing the world, headache, tiredness, fear of other acid attacks. They also feel despondent and worried as they think they turned an outcast from society. The victim's life gets derailed as every time she looks in the mirror she is reminded of her present insecurity as well as the despondency of the future.Social and Economic consequences:The victims who are not married are likely not to get married as they suffer from many disabilities like blindness, deafness, and many others difficulties and our society's mindset is not that wide enough to accept a disabled person as their wife. They even do not get a job notwithstanding being qualified as they cannot meet up to the expectation of their employers as not having the 'personality. Instead of helping them, we make their life more annoying, as we commiserate them as we do not like to look at their faces for long. However, this approach needs to be changed as they are suffering not for their wrong, but due to the fault of some savage animals roaming around the society freely.sAs per the provision of the "Prevention of Offences (by Acids) Act 2008,(National Commission for Woman â€“ Draft Bill)" constitute the definition of Acid Attacks and Acid.According to Section 3 of said Act:"Acid" shall mean and includes any substance which has the character of acidic or corrosive or burning nature that is capable of causing bodily injuries leading to scars or disfigurement or temporary or permanent disability."Acid attack" means any act of throwing acid or using acid in any form on the victim with the intent of or with the knowledge that such person is likely to cause to the other person Permanent or partial damage or deformity or disfiguration to any part of the body of such person.
